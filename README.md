<p>A Blind Navigation System is a technology that helps blind or visually impaired individuals navigate unfamiliar environments. This can include audible directions, haptic feedback, and other sensory cues to help the user orient themselves and move around safely. Some examples of blind navigation systems include GPS-based systems that provide spoken directions, as well as tactile maps that can be felt with the hands. These systems can help increase independence and mobility for blind individuals, allowing them to navigate unfamiliar places with greater ease and confidence.</p>
